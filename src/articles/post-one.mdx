In this article i go over how i got started in learning how to code
and the events that led up to that.

<h1 className="font-bold text-2xl text-new-100">How it started</h1>

I was studying a networking course at a certain local college and I had a close friend who was going to the same school as me. One day when we were walking home he told me about a certain project he was working on in `PHP`. It was a really interesting project he was collaborating with his colleagues. We talked for sometime and I told him about how I dabled lightly in HTML and CSS.

<br>

After that conversation I decided to take programming seriously. I picked up a book <strong>HTML and CSS design and build websites</strong> by Jon Duckett. I read this book from cover to cover and I started practicing what I learnt in there. In a short while I had learned <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. What was left is Javascript.

I had a had time wrapping my head around programming concepts. Concepts like `this`, `closures` were like alien language to me. But thanks to <a href="https://youtube.com/traversymedia">Traversy Media</a> and other YouTube content creators I was able to understand JavaScript and added it to my arsenal.

  Frontend Frameworks (Vue and React)
</h1>

After I learned Javascript i started building small websites; But as my knowledge grew it became increasingly hard to build things with just these technologies. Because of that I picked up my first frontend framework: <a className="text-blue-600 font-semibold" href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>. I fell in love with vue from the first time i read about it. Working with it for sometime really cemented this love. The way it made building apps easy and intuitive was the best thing that I ever saw and learning curve was really negligible. Before long I heard about <a className="text-blue-600 font-semibold" href="https://nuxtjs.org">Nuxt.js</a> which is a meta-framework for vue that further simplifies building and architecting progressive SPAs. Me and Vue was like a match made in heaven.

<br>

As time went by I decided to learn <a className="text-blue-600 font-semibold" href="https://reactjs.org">React.js</a> which is another JavaScript library for building intuitive UIs. Building applications with React and Vue is for the most part the same as they build upon similar concepts like virtual DOM, props and routing. For React I learned <a className="text-blue-600 font-semibold" href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> which is also a meta-framework that makes building Server-Side rendered apps a breeze.

<h1 className="font-bold text-2xl text-new-100">Conclusion</h1>

Looking back, I realize I have learned a lot of technologies, frameworks and libraries that can fill a whole page. I'm glad I got to learn all these things as this knowledge has given me a new perspective on the world and what it takes to build software. I intend to use my knowledge to build applications to help other people and make my life better.
