This article is inspired by <a href="https://leonardqmarcq.com/posts/how-to-build-your-own-blog-with-nextjs">Leonard Marc's article on why everyone should have a blog and how to build one in nextjs</a>. I won't go into much depth here so I recommend this read for more details. 

<br />
<h1 className="font-bold text-2xl text-new-100">Why even have my own blog</h1>
<br />

In my learning process I came across a lot of articles that recommended having your own blog as a Software Engineer. Building and publishing your own blog has always been a scary thing to me; I never felt I had enough knowledge to blog(or so i thought). After being motivated by some developers on twitter I finally decided to give it a chance and jump right in!

<br />

When it come to building blogs there are a lot of options on the market to choose from. WordPress, Gatsby, Contentful, Sanity are some of the CMS options you can consider. As for me i decided to settle for MDX and Next.js because I already knew Next and integrating with MDX(Markdown + JSX) is a breeze.

<br />

For working with MDX i choose to use <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote">next-mdx-remote</a> as it allows mdx to be loaded within `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` and hydrated correctly on the client. Working with MDX was a truly immersive experience; I learned a great deal about Markdown and SSG.

For example, below is a snippet of code I wrote for getting an article from a slug

```jsx
export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const { slug } = params;
  const { content, frontmatter } = await getArticleFromSlug(slug);

  const source = await serialize(content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      rehypePlugins: [
        rehypeSlug as Pluggable<[Settings?], Settings>,
        [
          rehypeAutolinkHeadings as Plugin<[Settings?], Settings>,
          {
            properties: { className: ["anchor"] },
          },
        ],
        rehypeHighlight as Pluggable<[Settings?], Settings>,
        rehypeCodeTitles,
      ],
    },
  });

  return {
    props: {
      post: {
        source,
        frontmatter,
      },
    },
  };
};

```

<h1 className="font-bold text-2xl text-new-100">Issues with MDX</h1>

While working with MDX I came across some issues i ended up fixing and learning from.

These are the bugs i encountered(created some myself):

- `[slug] page returning 404 when trying to access an article`. The issue here was that the individual page for an article was not generated properly. I changed the code for generating a new slug page to look like this:
```jsx
export async function getSlug() {
  const articles = fs.readdirSync(articlesPath);

  return articles.map((path) => {
    // holds the paths to the directory of the article
    const parts = path.split("/");
    const fileName = parts[parts.length - 1]; // gets the last part of path with /name.mdx
    const [slug, _extension] = fileName.split(".");

    return slug;
  });
}
```
and for generating a path:
```jsx
// dynamically generate the slugs for each article(s)
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  // getting all paths of each article as an array of
  // objects with their unique slugs
  const paths = (await getSlug()).map((slug) => ({ params: { slug } }));
  return {
    paths,
    // in situations where you try to access a path
    // that does not exist. it'll return a 404 page
    fallback: false,
  };
};
```
- `SyntaxError: unknown: Unterminated JSX contents. (23:16)`. This was an issue of unterminated element. I found that I has a `<br>` tag not closed. Solved it by terminating it like so:`<br />`;

<h1 className="font-bold text-2xl text-new-100">Conclusion</h1>
<br />

Building my own blog has taught me a lot of things including working with technologies like MDX and solving obscure bugs. I also had a chance to put to paper my thoughts, ideas, journey and overall what I have learned. I wish I started sooner but all is well that ends well. For new developers(or veterans) I recommend having your own blog. Even if you won't be writing technical content but writing your own thoughts and detailing your journey is more than enough. As a Software Engineer it allows you learn, grow and help other developers. So if you have not started yet go out there and build your own blog!
